This is a starting point for Go solutions to the
["Build Your Own BitTorrent" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/bittorrent/overview).

In this challenge, you’ll build a BitTorrent client that's capable of parsing a
.torrent file and downloading a file from a peer. Along the way, we’ll learn
about how torrent files are structured, HTTP trackers, BitTorrent’s Peer
Protocol, pipelining and more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
